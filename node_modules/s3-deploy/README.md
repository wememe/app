# s3-deploy

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/import-io/s3-deploy.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

NodeJS bash utility for deploying files to Amazon S3

## Usage

```
s3-deploy './dist/**' --cwd './dist/' --region AWS_REGION --bucket SOME_BUCKET_NAME --distId CF_DIST_ID --invalidate '/INV_PATH_1 /INV_PATH_2'
```

Deploys files found by the `./dist/**` glob patten to S3. Change `AWS_REGION` with the AWS region of your bucket and `SOME_BUCKET_NAME` with the name of your bucket where files should end up. It's a common scenario to invalidate files in CloudFront distribution, just pass distribution ID to `--distId` to invalidate everything.

### Optional parameters

```
--gzip [ETX,...]
```

Specifying `--gzip` will gzip all files before sending them to S3, and adds appropriate `Content-Encoding: gzip` metadata attribute on uploaded elements in S3, so that when they are opened in the browser, the browser knows to decompress them first before displaying. You can specify the list of file extensions to gzip, e.g. `--gzip xml,html,htm,js,css,ttf,otf,svg,txt`.

```
--cache X
```

Use this parameter to specify the `Cache-Control: max-age=X` header, where X is the number of seconds a given item will be kept in the cache for. By default this value is undefined.

This parameter cannot be used with `--immutable` or `--noCache` parameters. If those are used together, only the first one will be taken into account in the order 1) `noCache`, 2) `cache`, 3) `immutable`.

```
--preventUpdates
```

Use this parameter to validate that the object either currently does not exist in the bucket, or
that it already matches the ETag hash and thus is skipped and not uploaded. This effectively ensures that S3 Objects will not be modified. This is useful with the `--immutable` flag.

```
--immutable
```

When a page is refreshed, which is an extremely common social media scenario, elements that were previously marked immutable with an HTTP response header do not have to be revalidated with the server. It sets the `Cache-Control: immutable` header - [using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/01/using-immutable-caching-to-speed-up-the-web/) This is useful with the `--preventUpdates` flag.

This parameter cannot be used with `--cache` or `--noCache` parameters. If those are used together, only the first one will be taken into account in the order 1) `noCache`, 2) `cache`, 3) `immutable`.

```
--noCache
```

Use this parameter to specify `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` header, where files with those headers won't be cached on the client side, and will force all browsers and CloudFront to grab the assets straight from S3.

This parameter cannot be used with `--cache` or `--immutable` parameters. If those are used together, only the first one will be taken into account in the order 1) `noCache`, 2) `cache`, 3) `immutable`.

```
--etag X
```

You can also specify the `ETag: X` header, where X is either user-defined value for this header, or MD5 of the content. To automatically fill this header with MD5 hash of the file, just use `--etag` parameter without any value. Internally the tool will generate MD5 hash of the content and will set it as the ETag header value. By default this parameter is undefined.

```
--signatureVersion v4
```

You can also specify the `signatureVersion` that should be used by S3 client. Current allowed values are the same as in the constructor of the [S3 JS SDK Client](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/S3.html#constructor-property). In the time of writing those docs those values were `v2`, `v3` and `v4`.

```
--filePrefix
```

Use this parameter to specify a file prefix for all your destination files. For example, if you wanted to deploy a versioned history of your project to S3 whenever publishing to npm, you could use `--filePrefix $npm_package_version` in a script in your project's package.json file.

```
--profile
```

You can specify a specific AWS profile to use to connect to S3 (defaults to `default`). More information on how to setup AWS profiles is available in the [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html).

```
--private
```

Use this parameter to specify that objects being uploaded will be stored with private ACL (Owner gets FULL_CONTROL. No one else has access rights). By default, 'public-read' ACL is set. More information on the canned-acl is available in the [AWS docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#canned-acl)

```
--ext
```

Enables to set the correct content type header when files has no extension. For example, when the s3 bucket is used for webhosting and there is need to access paths like `/about` instead of `/about.html` so its possible to upload file named `about` and set `--ext html`

```
--deleteRemoved
```

Removes files in S3, that are not available in the local copy of the directory. Useful to cleanup files that should no longer reside in the remote version.
Now it also has the abilityto specify glob pattern that defines filter for files that should be considered to be deleted.

```
--index
```

If a filename in a subdirectory matches the index file, then upload two additional copies of the file: one with the same name as the directory, and one with the name of the directory followed by "/". This can be used to fake "index.html" on S3 and CloudFront, which normally has no concept of default index files.

```
--distId
```

CloudFront Distribution ID. Use along with `--invalidate` to invalides files within given distribution. In case `--invalidate` isn't provided everything is invalidated.

```
--invalidate
```

Paths to invalidate within CloudFront distribution. Value must be wrapped with quotes and each file separated by whitespace character. `--distId` argument is mandatory. Defaults to `['/']`. More details here:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Invalidation.html.

## AWS Credentials

AWS credentials can be provided via environment variables, or in the `~/.aws/credentials` file. More details here:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/topic/config-vars.html. Please make sure to define a default in your AWS credentials, this will help prevent a `Missing Credentials` error during deployment.

## Releasing

* Commit changes to the repository on a separate branch,
* Bump version in package.json file, after you are done with your changes (remember about SemVer!),
* After you are done with your functionality, or if you think it is large enough, create a pull request with master branch to be peer reviewed,
* After changes are merged into master branch, checkout master branch, run tests one more time, and publish this package to npm repository.

## Changelog

### 1.3.0

Adding new parameter `--noCache` that prevents caching of assets, and forces them to be grabbed straight from S3.

### 1.2.0

Adding ability to specify glob pattern to `removeDeleted` that defines filter for files that should be considered to be deleted.

### 1.1.5

* Bug fix for `invalidate` flag. https://github.com/import-io/s3-deploy/pull/79

### 1.1.4

**Build process cleanup & vinerability fixes**

### 1.1.2

**Delete S3 objects recursively**

- Support delete objects recursively for option `--deleteRemoved`
- Reason: S3 listObjects only limit `MaxKeys: 1000`, so in case your deploy contains many files (much more than 1000), it may cause unexpected result (usually, it cannot delete all the necessary files)
- This fork make sure all files in S3 will be `--deleteRemoved` if they are not matched with local files.
